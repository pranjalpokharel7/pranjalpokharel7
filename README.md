#### About This Github Profile:

The owner of this GitHub Profile is currently a 2nd year Bachelor in Computer Engineering (BCT) student at Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Nepal, passively struggling 
against dogmatic university practices and inclinations to procrastinate through over-consumption Japanese Manga/Anime, all the while trying to churn out the tiniest bit of time for programming.\

Driven by ego that lies within, for better or for worse.
